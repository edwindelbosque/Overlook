## Design Process

I started the process by exploring a few hotel booking websites to get a general idea on color palettes and general structure of the pages, afterwards I came up with my own ideas.

A few design aspects changed over the week as I started coding more.
I think it is essential to experience by yourself how a product works before you actually build it, it gave me a better idea on the steps of booking a hotel room and how I could implement them myself into my project.

## Goals

- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Separate business-logic code from view-related code
- Use of a separate domUpdates.js file that handles any DOM manipulation
- Synthesize knowledge of OOP, classes, and JS fundamentals
- Write a program and UI/UX from scratch
- Build this application by reading user stories
- Fetch APIs to retrieve data
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle) and SOLID principle
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
- Use of spies for testing the DOM manipulation

## Built with:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- SASS
- Mocha, Chai & Spies
- Sketch
